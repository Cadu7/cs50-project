#### Description: 


This project is a **task management (to-do list) application** designed to allow users to organize their activities in a **structured, visual, and flexible way**, separating tasks by **subjects** and distributing them over time according to their **monthly deadlines**.

The application was designed to support real-life personal and professional organization scenarios, offering full control over lists, tasks, deadlines, and priorities, all within a clean and intuitive interface.

### Organization by Subject Lists

The project is based on the concept of **subject-based task lists**. Each list represents a specific theme or area of the user’s life, such as:

- College
- Car
- Personal projects
- Work
- Studies

Users can create as many lists as they want, edit their names, or delete them entirely. This allows for a logical separation of tasks, preventing activities from different contexts from being mixed together.

Navigation between lists is done through a selector at the top of the application, making it quick and easy to switch between different subjects.

### Organization by Months (Task Deadlines)

Within each subject list, tasks are organized by **months and years**, which represent the **final deadline** of each task.

For example:
- A task added under **February 2026** means its deadline is in that month.
- The columns displayed in the interface represent months, making it easier to visualize tasks chronologically.

This approach gives users a clear view of what needs to be done in each period, helping with monthly planning and tracking future commitments.

### Task Creation and Management

Users can create multiple tasks within each subject list. Each task includes essential information for organization and tracking:

- **Task title**, clearly describing the activity to be completed.
- **Deadline**, which defines the month and year the task must be completed.
- **Priority**, indicating the task’s level of importance.

Tasks are displayed within the month corresponding to their deadline, keeping the temporal organization clear and intuitive.

### Priority and Deadline System

The **priority and deadline system** is a core part of the application’s design. Each task combines a defined deadline with a priority level, allowing users to manage not only *when* something must be done, but also *how important* it is.

Deadlines provide a clear temporal structure, ensuring tasks are associated with a specific month and preventing them from becoming forgotten or lost over time. Priorities add an additional layer of control, making it easy to identify urgent or critical tasks even when multiple deadlines exist within the same period.

This combination helps users make better decisions about what to focus on first, especially in scenarios where time and attention are limited.

### Design Decision: Multiple Context-Based Lists

One of the key design decisions in this project was implementing **multiple lists based on different contexts or subjects**, rather than a single global task list. This proved to be an effective and well-thought-out approach, as it mirrors how people naturally organize responsibilities in real life.

Separating tasks by context (such as college, work, or personal matters) reduces cognitive overload and keeps related activities grouped together. This design choice improves clarity, scalability, and usability, allowing the application to grow with the user’s needs without becoming cluttered or confusing.

The result is a system that feels natural, organized, and adaptable, making task management more efficient and enjoyable.

## Full Editing and Flexibility

The application provides **full control over both lists and tasks**, allowing adjustments at any time as plans change.

Users can:
- Edit task.
- Modify tasks priorities.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Create new subject lists.
- Edit or delete entire lists.

This flexibility ensures the system adapts to the user’s routine, allowing tasks to be fully reorganized whenever necessary.

## Interface and Usability

The interface was developed with a focus on **clarity and ease of use**. Subject lists are displayed separately, while months appear as columns, visually organizing tasks according to their deadlines.

Each task is presented as a card containing its key information in a concise format. This visual structure makes it easier to understand the flow of tasks over time, even when many activities are registered.
