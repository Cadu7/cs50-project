#### Description: 


This project is a **task management (to-do list) application** designed to allow users to organize their activities in a **structured, visual, and flexible way**, separating tasks by **subjects** and distributing them over time according to their **monthly deadlines**.

The application was designed to support real-life personal and professional organization scenarios, offering full control over lists, tasks, deadlines, and priorities, all within a clean and intuitive interface.

### Organization by Subject Lists

The project is based on the concept of **subject-based task lists**. Each list represents a specific theme or area of the user’s life, such as:

- College
- Car
- Personal projects
- Work
- Studies

Users can create as many lists as they want, edit their names, or delete them entirely. This allows for a logical separation of tasks, preventing activities from different contexts from being mixed together.

Navigation between lists is done through a selector at the top of the application, making it quick and easy to switch between different subjects.

### Organization by Months (Task Deadlines)

Within each subject list, tasks are organized by **months and years**, which represent the **final deadline** of each task.

For example:
- A task added under **February 2026** means its deadline is in that month.
- The columns displayed in the interface represent months, making it easier to visualize tasks chronologically.

This approach gives users a clear view of what needs to be done in each period, helping with monthly planning and tracking future commitments.

### Task Creation and Management

Users can create multiple tasks within each subject list. Each task includes essential information for organization and tracking:

- **Task title**, clearly describing the activity to be completed.
- **Deadline**, which defines the month and year the task must be completed.
- **Priority**, indicating the task’s level of importance.

Tasks are displayed within the month corresponding to their deadline, keeping the temporal organization clear and intuitive.

### Priority System

Each task has a **priority level**, allowing users to quickly identify which activities require more attention.

With this system, users can:
- Set priorities when creating a task.
- Change the priority at any time.
- Visually distinguish more important or urgent tasks.

This helps users focus on what truly matters, especially when many tasks are spread across different months.

### Full Editing and Flexibility

The application provides **full control over both lists and tasks**, allowing adjustments at any time as plans change.

Users can:
- Edit task.
- Modify tasks priorities.
- Delete individual tasks.
- Create new subject lists.
- Edit or delete entire lists.

This flexibility ensures the system adapts to the user’s routine, allowing tasks to be fully reorganized whenever necessary.
